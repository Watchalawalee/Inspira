MOTIVATIONS The first of its caliber in Southeast Asia, CULTIVATE offers professional development aimed at equipping a new generation of locally rooted and internationally-informed leaders to elevate the standards of arts in the region. This is needed to strengthen the capacity of cultural institutions in Southeast Asia to establish mutually generative international collaborations. The sector increasingly demands internationally competent expertise to realize programs that are resonant and relevant to both local and global contexts. Supporting Southeast Asian cultural histories, heritage, and methodologies is inseparable from our participation on the world stage. Many regional economies are reliant on cultural tourism, which requires developing our own local talents into innovative stars, equipped to elevate community-rooted stories for global audiences. Southeast Asia’s cultural industry requires infrastructural and talent development to captivate both local and international attention and investments toward re-writing the art histories of our region on our own terms. If Southeast Asian cultural initiatives are to innovate and participate globally, we must cultivate local talent and equip them with resources and experience. Rather than removing participants from the workforce, CULTIVATE leverages their ongoing careers as practical case studies and educational opportunities. Participants’ local institutions, programs, and audiences directly benefit from CULTIVATE top-tier faculty consultation on these live case studies. By convening local and international talents to address on-the-ground issues in Southeast Asia, CULTIVATE aims to nurture more diversified ‘centers’ of the global art world.",
